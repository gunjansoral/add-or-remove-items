List Management App

The List Management App is a JavaScript application that allows users to manage items in two separate lists: an "Added Items" list and a "Removed Items" list. Users can add items from the "Removed Items" list to the "Added Items" list and remove items from both lists.

Technologies Used
The List Management App is built using the following technologies:

JavaScript: The core programming language used to develop the application's functionality.
HTML: The markup language used for creating the structure of the application.
CSS: The style sheet language used for designing the visual appearance of the application.
DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is utilized to dynamically update and render the lists based on user actions.
Features
Two separate lists: "Added Items" and "Removed Items."
Each list displays items with checkboxes and labels.
Users can add items from the "Removed Items" list to the "Added Items" list.
Users can remove items from both lists.
Lists are dynamically rendered and updated in real-time as users interact with the application.
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/list-management-app.git
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Interact with the application by checking/unchecking items and clicking the "Add" or "Remove" buttons.

The lists will be updated based on your actions, and you can observe the changes on the screen.

Code Structure
The List class represents a single list and handles rendering, adding items, and removing items.
The ListItems class represents an individual item in the lists, containing properties like isChecked and label.
The App class serves as the main entry point of the application, managing the two lists and their interactions.
